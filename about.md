## About

Welcome to SpeakOUT! We strive to be a space where people can comment, talk, and come together to solve or improve an issue. Keep reading to learn how to best use SpeakOUT. Email "salesn@catlin.edu" if you need anything.

### Get Started

SpeakOUT has a few main components. The home page houses *Issue pages*. You (the users) create these issue pages about whatever you want. Your page must answer the following questions.

* What is the issue?
* Why itâ€™s important?
* How has it affected people negatively?
* ***How can users help?*** This one is key.

We have a very strict use policy, as this kind of site has the potential to turn ugly. Please review the document <a href="/activism/standards/">here</a>. All users are required to abide by these rules.

SpeakOUT issue pages use the Github Markdown for page layout and styling. You can look at the <a href="/activism/template/">template page</a> to get started with Markdown.

We are working on a video tutorial. We will post it on this page once it's done.
