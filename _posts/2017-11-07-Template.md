The main body of the issue should go here. If you want to link something, use this method: <a href="#">Link text</a>
you can make newlines and *italicize things by enclosing them in asterisks*

> To make a quote box, you can put a greater than sign, and make everything on one line.

You can make things **bold** by enclosing them in two asterisks.

# Single
## Double
### Triple
#### Quadruple

To make a title, put 1, 2, 4, or 4 hashtags "#" in front of the title text.

To make a bullet point list, put an asterisk character in front of each item.
* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3

Other lists include numbers. Just put the number and a dot after.
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3

Enclosing things in the key that also makes the ~ character, makes them look like `this`.

There are many more complicated things you can use as well. These are called HTML elements.
They are used by putting the opening tag on one side, and the closing tag on the other.

`<name>Text</name>`

The `name` can be changed to many things. Some are listed below. The closing tag is just the opening tag with a slash "/" in front.

Examples:

- <del>Strikethrough</del>
- <abbr>Abbreviations</abbr> (This is used for Abbreviations, and isn't super important.)
- Superscript<sup>Text</sup>
- Subscript<sub>Text</sub>
- <ins>Inserted</ins>
- <cite>Citations</cite>

HTML defines a long list of available inline tags, a complete list of which can be found on the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element).

If you press the key that has a ~ on it, and use that character three times, it makes this:

```
Some cool interesting statement
```


## Photos

Photos can be made by doing the following:

`![placeholder](https://www.linktoimage.com/ "Image not found")`

The text that says placeholder can stay the same, the the https part is the link to an image, and leave the "Image not found" text. It shows if the image can't be found.

![placeholder](https://placehold.it/800x400 "Large example image")
